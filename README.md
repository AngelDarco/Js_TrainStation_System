# Train Station Passenger Counting System

#### We need to control the number of passengers arriving at the end of a journey taking into account how many get on and off at each stop.
#### We will provide you with a list of the type: [s1,b1][s2,b2][s3,b3]â€¦ where each pair of elements includes the number of passengers getting on (s) and the number of passengers getting off (b ). Thus, processing that list, we will know the number of final passengers that should arrive at the end of the journey.
##### Input example: [[7.0][8.2][9.5][3.1]]
##### Output example: 19 passengers
##### * Note: In the first pair of numbers, the second will always be 0 because no one gets off at the station of origin. It is not necessary to control that number: we will always provide it correctly.
